# TF2 Logs Stats

#### Get the statistics from your last 200 logs from logs.tf! ####

Quick project I did to get your stats from logs.tf including:

* Number of games won
* Most played class
* Best dpm
* Average dpm
* Average kdr

On the main page you need to put your STEAMID64 and select the type of game mode you want your stats from (6v6 or HL).
Your stats are then retrieved using the [logs.tf API](http://logs.tf/about#json/ "API documentation"). Duplicate logs are ignored.
